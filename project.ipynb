        "Most malware runs as a background service. However, starting in Android version 3.1, apps cannot create a service without having an activity associated with that service. Therefore, a malicious app must first create an activity. Next, to hide the activity, the app can employ two approaches: making the activity transparent or destroying the activity before it becomes visible. To render an activity transparent, a malicious app needs to make the activity’s main layout transparent, set the activity as full screen, then remove the action bar and window title. These values can be set in the app’s manifest file. In addition, malware can also accomplish this via certain API methods. For example, Android API methods setBackground(), setBackgroundDrawable() or setBackgroundColor() can change the activity to transparent. Methods addFlags(), setFlags(), or requestWindowFeature() can change the window to full screen, as well as remove the action bar and the window title. We now illustrate this with malware DroidKungFu3. First, the manifest file is used to make the activity layout transparent: ...\n",

        "A malicious app can use the block call feature to prevent certain numbers from contacting the device. This can be done by intercepting incoming calls and disconnecting them before the user is notified. The malware achieves this by registering a broadcast receiver to listen for incoming calls and checking the caller's number. If the number matches a predefined list of blocked numbers, the malware ends the call using the endCall() method. Additionally, the malware may remove the corresponding entry from the call logs to cover its tracks. For example, the Trojan:Blocker.A malware employs this technique to block calls from specific contacts without the user's knowledge.\n",

To prevent users from realizing this, the malware needs to block the phone call. If the malware received an intent android.intent.action.PHONE_STATE and the number of the caller is the C&C server, then the ringer mode is set to silent to suppress the notification of the incoming call and the phone call is disconnected. Its corresponding entry from the call logs is also removed, removing all traces of the phone call. An example is malware fakeAV that uses endCall() to cancel the incoming call.\n",
