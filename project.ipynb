        "1. A malicious app can use the block call feature to prevent certain numbers from contacting the device. This can be done by intercepting incoming calls and disconnecting them before the user is notified. The malware achieves this by registering a broadcast receiver to listen for incoming calls and checking the caller's number. If the number matches a predefined list of blocked numbers, the malware ends the call using the endCall() method. Additionally, the malware may remove the corresponding entry from the call logs to cover its tracks. For example, the Trojan:Blocker.A malware employs this technique to block calls from specific contacts without the user's knowledge.\n",
        "2. For malware that is part of a botnet, the command and control (C&C) server could call the infected phone to ask the bot (malware app) to perform certain services; the C&C server is encoded in the phone number. To prevent users from realizing this, the malware needs to block the phone call. If the malware received an intent android.intent.action.PHONE_STATE and the number of the caller is the C&C server, then the ringer mode is set to silent to suppress the notification of the incoming call and the phone call is disconnected. Its corresponding entry from the call logs is also removed, removing all traces of the phone call. An example is malware fakeAV that uses endCall() to cancel the incoming call.\n",
